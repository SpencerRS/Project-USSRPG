Development of an RPG companion app.

Dice Reference: http://game2.ca/eote/#

Characters are comprised of 2-7(?) words; up to 3 Attributes, up to 2 Abilities and up to 5 Traits
Characters have 4 key stats, Health Points (HP), Stamina/Energy Points (SP/EP), Cinematic Points (CP), and Experience Points (XP).

Each card in the Player’s deck has 2 values, Suit (Y axis) and Value (X axis). The lower of the two represents the card’s Yellow value, while the difference represents the Green value.

Players play cards from their hands, which they draw from 1 of 3 decks. Players maintain 




Basics: Players generate several words defining their character and spend points (XP) to increase the rank value of each. The nature of the word (part of speech; ie. nouns, verbs, adjectives) slots it within the character’s basic build: 
The character’s class or classes take the form of Nouns, such as the classic Fighter, Rogue and  Warlock. However, this system is loose enough to support anything, such as Cop, Doctor or Bartender.

App Concepts:

Enforce/recommend part of speech?
Character Journal automated and akin to social [aside from MP, social gameplay)
Record/track character state at time of progression (location, companions, quest, enemies) and allow more notes to be added
Synchronous local host, join and play multiplayer (or remote with user-facing camera and mic?)
Intuitive GM interphase and controls
Detailed/thorough tooltip integration.
Generate dice pool. Roll virtual (3D) dice and calculate results (show results on all screens)
Shake phone/gyroscope to rattle dice to randomize without rolling. Swipe to roll with physics impulse
Virtual deck and hand. Draw, discard and play cards (show results on all screens; trigger Host/GM response phase
Track game world as buckets within buckets (nested locations, characters, npcs, items, factions and nested factions)
Track turn order and character stats
Limit what is editable by the players
Send out alerts whenever the GM makes a change (with sfx?)
Utilize voice recognition for data entry?
